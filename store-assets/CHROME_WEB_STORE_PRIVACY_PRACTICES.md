# Chrome Web Store Privacy Practices - Copy & Paste Guide

## üîí **Privacy Practices Tab Requirements**

Copy and paste these exact justifications into your Chrome Web Store Privacy Practices tab:

---

### **1. Single Purpose Description**
```
Adds keyboard shortcuts for voice dictation on ChatGPT pages to boost productivity by enabling users to start, submit, and cancel voice dictation using ALT+SPACE and ALT+ESC keyboard shortcuts.
```

---

### **2. activeTab Permission Justification**
```
The activeTab permission is used to inject keyboard shortcut functionality into the currently active ChatGPT tab. This allows the extension to add ALT+SPACE and ALT+ESC keyboard listeners only when the user is actively using a ChatGPT page, enabling voice dictation control without requiring broad access to all websites.
```

---

### **3. Host Permission (https://chatgpt.com/*) Justification**
```
The host permission for https://chatgpt.com/* is required to automatically activate the extension's keyboard shortcuts on ChatGPT pages. This permission allows the extension to inject content scripts that provide voice dictation keyboard shortcuts (ALT+SPACE to start/submit, ALT+ESC to cancel) specifically on ChatGPT domains only.
```

---

### **4. Scripting Permission Justification**
```
The scripting permission is used to inject keyboard shortcut functionality into ChatGPT pages. This enables the extension to add event listeners for ALT+SPACE and ALT+ESC keyboard shortcuts that control ChatGPT's built-in voice dictation feature. No user data is accessed or modified - only keyboard shortcuts are added to improve user productivity.
```

---

### **5. Remote Code Use Justification**
```
The extension does not use any remote code. All code is contained within the extension package and no external scripts, APIs, or remote resources are loaded or executed.
```
